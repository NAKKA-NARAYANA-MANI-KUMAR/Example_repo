**Parse this medical laboratory report and convert it to standardized JSON format. Extract all available Fitness Assessment biomarkers and convert them to the specified units below. Return only a single JSON object with patient information and biomarker values (skip all null/missing values).**

## PATIENT INFO FORMAT:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT FULL NAME",
  "age": number,
  "sex": "Male" or "Female",
  "cycle": "All"
}
```

## STANDARDIZED FITNESS ASSESSMENT BIOMARKER UNITS:
Balance and Posture:BALANCE_AND_POSTURE : Score
Upper Body Strength:UPPER_BODY_STRENGTH : Score
Lower Body Strength:LOWER_BODY_STRENGTH : Score
Agility:AGILITY : Score
Power:POWER : Score
Aerobic Capacity:VO2_MAX : ml/kg/min
Upper Body Flexibility:UPPER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY : Score
Lower Body Flexibility:LOWER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY : Score
Hand Eye Coordination:HAND_EYE_COORDINATION : Score
Reaction Time:REACTION_TIME : ms
Total PMX Fitness Score:TOTAL_FITNESS_SCORE : Score
Interpretation:INTERPRETATION : Text

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. **Biomarker Format**: Each biomarker is listed as `FULL BIOMARKER NAME:VARIABLE_NAME : unit`
   - Search for the FULL BIOMARKER NAME in the PDF report
   - In the output JSON, use the VARIABLE_NAME (short code after the colon)
   - Example: For "Balance and Posture:BALANCE_AND_POSTURE : Score" → search PDF for "Balance and Posture" → output as `{"BALANCE_AND_POSTURE": value}`
2. **Skip null values** - only include biomarkers that have actual values in the report
3. **Handle alternative names**: 
   - Balance and Posture = BALANCE_AND_POSTURE
   - Upper Body Strength = UPPER_BODY_STRENGTH
   - Lower Body Strength = LOWER_BODY_STRENGTH
   - Agility = AGILITY
   - Power = POWER
   - Aerobic Capacity = VO2_MAX
   - Upper Body Flexibility = UPPER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY
   - Lower Body Flexibility = LOWER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY
   - Hand Eye Coordination = HAND_EYE_COORDINATION
   - Reaction Time = REACTION_TIME
   - Total PMX Fitness Score = TOTAL_FITNESS_SCORE
   - Interpretation = INTERPRETATION
4. **No unit conversions needed** - extract values as they appear in the report
5. **Use "Male" or "Female"** for sex (never abbreviations)
6. **Include patient demographics** (name, age, sex, cycle)
7. **Handle different value types**:
   - Scores: Extract numerical values
   - VO2_MAX: Extract in ml/kg/min units
   - Reaction Time: Extract in milliseconds (ms)
   - Interpretation: Extract as text description
8. **Look for these specific terms** in the PDF:
   - "Balance and Posture"
   - "Upper Body Strength"
   - "Lower Body Strength"
   - "Agility"
   - "Power"
   - "Aerobic Capacity"
   - "Upper Body Flexibility"
   - "Lower Body Flexibility"
   - "Hand Eye Coordination"
   - "Reaction Time"
   - "Total PMX Fitness Score"
   - "Interpretation"
9. **For Interpretation field**: Extract the complete interpretation/assessment text, but stop before any "Limitation:" sections. Include the full descriptive assessment text, whatever it may be, but exclude any limitation content that starts with "Limitation:". 

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a clean JSON object with patient info and only the biomarkers found in the report (no null values).
Use the VARIABLE_NAME (short codes) as JSON keys, NOT the full biomarker names.

Example output format:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT NAME",
  "age": 35,
  "sex": "Male",
  "cycle": "All",
  "BALANCE_AND_POSTURE": 85,
  "UPPER_BODY_STRENGTH": 78,
  "LOWER_BODY_STRENGTH": 82,
  "AGILITY": 75,
  "POWER": 88,
  "VO2_MAX": 45.2,
  "UPPER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY": 80,
  "LOWER_BODY_FLEXIBILITY": 85,
  "HAND_EYE_COORDINATION": 90,
  "REACTION_TIME": 250,
  "TOTAL_FITNESS_SCORE": 82,
  "INTERPRETATION": "Good overall fitness level"
}
```
