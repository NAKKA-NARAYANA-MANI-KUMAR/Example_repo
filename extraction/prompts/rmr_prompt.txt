**Parse this medical laboratory report and convert it to standardized JSON format. Extract all available RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) biomarkers and convert them to the specified units below. Return only a single JSON object with patient information and biomarker values (skip all null/missing values).**

## PATIENT INFO FORMAT:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT FULL NAME",
  "age": number,
  "sex": "Male" or "Female",
  "cycle": "All"
}
```

## STANDARDIZED RMR BIOMARKER UNITS:
Resting Energy Expenditure:REE : kcal/day
Your Metabolism [%]:YOUR_METABOLISM : %
Resting Heart Rate [bpm]:RHR : bpm
Heart Rate Variability:HRV : ms

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. **Biomarker Format**: Each biomarker is listed as `FULL BIOMARKER NAME:VARIABLE_NAME : unit`
   - Search for the FULL BIOMARKER NAME in the PDF report
   - In the output JSON, use the VARIABLE_NAME (short code after the colon)
   - Example: For "Resting Energy Expenditure:REE : kcal/day" → search PDF for "Resting Energy Expenditure" → output as `{"REE": value}`
2. **Skip null values** - only include biomarkers that have actual values in the report
3. **Handle alternative names**: 
   - Resting Energy Expenditure = REE
   - Your Metabolism [%] = YOUR_METABOLISM
   - Resting Heart Rate [bpm] = RHR
   - Heart Rate Variability = HRV
4. **No unit conversions needed** - extract values as they appear in the report
5. **Use "Male" or "Female"** for sex (never abbreviations)
6. **Include patient demographics** (name, age, sex, cycle)
7. **Handle decimal values** - preserve decimal places as shown in the report
8. **Look for these specific terms** in the PDF:
   - "Resting Energy Expenditure" (may appear as REE)
   - "Your Metabolism" or "Your Metabolism [%]" (percentage value)
   - "Resting Heart Rate" or "Resting Heart Rate [bpm]" (beats per minute)
   - "Heart Rate Variability" or "HRV" (milliseconds)

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a clean JSON object with patient info and only the biomarkers found in the report (no null values).
Use the VARIABLE_NAME (short codes) as JSON keys, NOT the full biomarker names.

Example output format:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT NAME",
  "age": 35,
  "sex": "Male",
  "cycle": "All",
  "REE": 1450.5,
  "YOUR_METABOLISM": 85.2,
  "RHR": 65,
  "HRV": 42.3
}
```
