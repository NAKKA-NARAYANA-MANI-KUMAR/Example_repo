**Parse this medical laboratory report and convert it to standardized JSON format. Extract all available COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT biomarkers. Return only a single JSON object with patient information and biomarker values (include all keys even if empty).**

## PATIENT INFO FORMAT:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT FULL NAME",
  "age": number,
  "sex": "Male" or "Female",
  "cycle": "All"
}
```

## STANDARDIZED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT BIOMARKER UNITS:
- Overall Brain Score:OVERALL_BRAIN_SCORE : score
- Attention:ATTENTION : score
- Immediate Memory:IMMEDIATE_MEMORY : score
- Working Memory:WORKING_MEMORY : score
- Brain Executive Function:BRAIN_EXECUTIVE_FUNCTION : score

## IMPORTANT EXTRACTION NOTES:
1. **Include ALL keys** - even if values are empty, include the key with null/empty value
2. **Extract exact values** as they appear in the report
3. **For scores** - extract the numerical values
4. **Search the entire document**: These values may be in different sections of the report
5. **Use "Male" or "Female"** for sex (never abbreviations)
6. **Include patient demographics** (name, age, sex, cycle)

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a clean JSON object with patient info and ALL biomarkers (even if empty).
Use the VARIABLE_NAME (short codes) as JSON keys.

Example output format:
```json
{
  "name": "PATIENT NAME",
  "age": 35,
  "sex": "Male",
  "cycle": "All",
  "OVERALL_BRAIN_SCORE": 85,
  "ATTENTION": 78,
  "IMMEDIATE_MEMORY": 82,
  "WORKING_MEMORY": 75,
  "BRAIN_EXECUTIVE_FUNCTION": 88
}
```
